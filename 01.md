**Computer Vision**

Computer vision is the study of visual data, which has exploded in the last couple of years due to the large number of sensors in the world. 
A 2015 study from Cisco estimated that by 2017, 80% of all traffic on the internet would be video, and it is critical to develop algorithms that can 
utilize and understand this data. However, there is a problem with visual data: it is hard to understand. Visual data is often referred to as the 
"dark matter" of the internet, as it is difficult for algorithms to understand and see all of the visual data on the web. This is exemplified by the 
fact that for every second of clock time that occurs in the world, approximately five hours of video are uploaded to YouTube.
Google has a lot of employees, but they cannot sit down and watch, understand, and annotate every video, so it is important to develop technologies 
that can dive in and automatically understand the content of visual data. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that touches on many different 
areas of science, engineering, and technology.

**History of Vision*

The evolution of vision can be traced back many millions of years, or approximately 543 million years. During this time, life was mostly 
on the water, and animals didn't move around much. However, something remarkable happened around 540 million years ago when the number of animal 
species exploded from a few to hundreds of thousands. This was known as "Evolution's Big Bang" and was a mystery for many years. Andrew Parker proposed 
one of the most convincing theories from fossils, which states that the first animals developed eyes and began to see, triggering an explosion of speciation. 
Vision has become the biggest sensory system of almost all animals, with almost 50% of the neurons in our cortex involved in visual processing. Vision is 
extremely important for animals, especially intelligent animals, and enables them to survive, work, move around, manipulate things, communicate, entertain, 
and do a variety of other things.
