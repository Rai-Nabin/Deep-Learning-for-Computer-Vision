### Computer Vision
-  Computer vision is the study of visual data.
- **Importance of Visual Data:**
    - The amount of visual data in the world has significantly increased due to the proliferation of sensors.
    - Smartphones, with their multiple cameras, contribute greatly to this increase.
    - There are likely more cameras in the world than people.
- **Internet Traffic:**
    - A 2015 Cisco study estimated that by 2017, approximately 80% of internet traffic would be video.
    - This statistic highlights the dominance of visual data on the internet.
- **Challenges of Visual Data:**
    - Visual data is often difficult to understand, likened to "dark matter" in physics.
    - Similar to dark matter, visual data comprises a large portion of the internet but is difficult to observe and interpret.
- **YouTube Example:**
    - Approximately 5 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every second.
    - The sheer volume of video content makes manual analysis and annotation impossible.
    - Automated technologies are necessary to understand and catalog visual data for purposes like serving relevant content and monetization.

- Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field, drawing from various areas of science, engineering, and technology.
- It intersects with:
    - Physics (optics and image formation)
    - Biology and psychology (animal vision and processing)
    - Computer science, mathematics, and engineering (algorithm development and system building)

### History of Vision

- **Biological Vision's Origins:**
    - The history of vision traces back approximately 540 million years.
    - At that time, Earth was primarily aquatic, with limited animal species.
    - Early life was passive, with organisms relying on chance encounters with food.
- **The Cambrian Explosion:**
    - Around 540 million years ago, a significant increase in animal species occurred within a relatively short period (10 million years).
    - This phenomenon, known as the Cambrian Explosion, puzzled evolutionary biologists.
    - Andrew Parker, a zoologist, proposed that the development of eyes and the onset of vision triggered this explosion.
- **The Impact of Vision:**
    - Vision enabled animals to become more proactive, with predators hunting prey and prey needing to evade predators.
    - This led to an "evolutionary arms race," driving rapid evolution for survival.
- **Vision's Significance:**
    - Over 540 million years, vision has become the dominant sensory system in most animals, especially intelligent ones.
    - In humans, approximately 50% of cortical neurons are involved in visual processing.
    - Vision plays a crucial role in survival, movement, manipulation, communication, and various other functions.4
